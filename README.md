# neuraknetwork


so hey guys welcome to PRAT UP TECH.........
 today i am going to show my project of a neural network which print's out all the possible conditions of three numbers...


 For this we need to pip install Numpy...
 PIP stands for PACKAGE INSTALLER PYTHON

 So to install pip we will have to run the following command in command prompt
 
 python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

 Now we will run the following command to install numpy

 pip install numpy




The link of the code is in the description.....

 Now let's see the coding and the output...
